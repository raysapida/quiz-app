# Quiz App made with jquery

## Requirements

* The app must lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see
one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered
the current one.

* Users should be able to input their answer to each question, with radio buttons
or some other appropriate interface.

* When the user answers the last question, the app should show his or her overall
score.

* Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll probably want
to store your list of questions in an array.

* Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5")

* Let the user know their score so far

* Let the user know if their previous response was correct

## Design details

* Background picture for each question

* Dog Days - busy summer pic, Summernight - Sunser pic,  Summer Glau - cameras pic
Buffy - girl turned away pic, Summertime - music pic

* Five icons on the right indicating which question a person is on. The icons
  are originally opaque but become clear if the user gets it right.

* A div element will pop up based on the answer inputed.

* A correct answer will show an icon of a person winning something and a wrong 
one will have an angry person.

* The end score will have a background image based how well they did.

* 0 - winter pic, 1 - map pic, 2 - beach far pic, 3 - close beach pic, 4 -
  swimming pic, and 5 - concert pic
